# TriviaGame

The goal of **Space Trivia** is to correctly answer all of the questions by selecting the correct button.

Wrong answers are scored separately from questions that are not answered.

This project was a class exercise in JavaScript and jQuery, as well as some work in CSS and HTML.

**Space Trivia** was coded by me, and is maintained by me.
